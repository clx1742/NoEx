The Social Operating System - Respect the law, don't fear it!

Every person, business, and culture develops with its own set of unique values. That's a great thing! However, it makes running a society a bit challenging... How do you hold everyone to the same set of laws when each person has a fundamentally different interpretation?

The NoEx Open Source Project seeks to build a universal platform for legal interoperability, communication, and collaboration. Our mission is to enable opposing ideas, rather than extinguish them.

Anything goes!  We need modules for taxes, privacy, intellectual property, healthcare, employment, you name it!
